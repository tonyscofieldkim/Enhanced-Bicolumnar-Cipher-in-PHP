# Enhanced-Bicolumnar-Cipher-in-PHP
This project involves a PHP implementation of Bicolumnar cipher cryptographic algorithm using ASCII as the alphabet . It will encrypt and decrypt strings only. 
--- The use   of the word  'Enhanced' here is due to the capability of the cipher to use the entire ASCII table as the alphabet and the capacity to derive the second key from the user provided key. The user may choose advanced mode to change ordinal values of characters in plaintext while encrypting in order to enhance message integrity.
